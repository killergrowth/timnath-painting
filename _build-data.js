    heroTitle: 'Exterior Painting in Northern Colorado That Lasts 10+ Years',
    intro: `Northern Colorado sees 28+ freeze-thaw cycles every year. UV radiation hits 10-15% harder at altitude. Wood siding expands and contracts with temperature swings that can exceed 60 degrees in a single day. Cheap paint jobs fail in 3-4 years here.

Timnath Painting builds exterior painting systems that last 7-10 years using premium prep, Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore coatings, and methods designed specifically for Zone 5b conditions. We are Licensed, Insured, and using premium eco-friendly, no-VOC products by Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore. $1M general liability coverage.`,
    process: `Every project starts with a full surface assessment. We identify substrate issues, previous coating failures, and moisture problems before prep begins.

<strong>Surface Preparation:</strong> We scrape all loose and peeling paint, sand smooth transitions, repair wood rot and damaged trim, caulk all gaps and joints with premium elastomeric sealants, and pressure wash to remove dirt, mildew, and chalking.

<strong>Coating Application:</strong> We use Sherwin-Williams Duration, Emerald, or SuperPaint, and Benjamin Moore Aura or Regal Select. Two-coat minimum on all surfaces. Three coats on south and west exposures where UV is most intense.

<strong>Project Management:</strong> You get a dedicated project lead, progress updates throughout the job, and full site cleanup. No subcontractors. No volume rushing.`,
    sidingTypes: [
      { type: 'Fiber Cement (HardiePlank / HardieBoard)', desc: 'The most common siding in newer Northern Colorado HOA communities. Holds paint extremely well when primed with an alkyd or 100% acrylic masonry primer. Must be clean and fully dry before coating. 7–10 year system lifespans are realistic with proper prep.' },
      { type: 'Wood / Cedar', desc: "Natural wood demands oil-based primer on every bare surface. Checks, splits, and open grain get caulked with flexible elastomeric sealant. Colorado\'s dry climate pulls moisture out of wood faster than coastal climates &mdash; older wood siding requires more prep time, and we factor that into every quote." },
      { type: 'T1-11 Plywood', desc: 'Common on older homes and outbuildings. The vertical grooves trap moisture and debris year-round. Requires aggressive cleaning and an elastomeric or 100% acrylic topcoat that can bridge hairline cracks without peeling.' },
      { type: 'Vinyl Siding', desc: 'Paintable with the correct adhesion primer.

    whyUs: `Our crew is owned, not subcontracted. That matters more than most homeowners realize &mdash; it means the same people who show up day one are there day five. No phone-tag with subs, no quality drop-off when we get busy and send whoever is available.

We use premium eco-friendly, no-VOC products by Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore exclusively � covering application practices, environmental compliance, and chemical handling &mdash; not just a marketing badge. It is also why we have access to Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore contractor programs that most local painters do not.

$1M general liability coverage means that if something goes wrong on your property, you are protected. We provide a certificate of insurance within 24 hours to any HOA board or property manager who requests one.`,
    timeline: `Most residential exterior painting projects in Northern Colorado take 3–5 business days, weather-dependent.

<strong>Prep Phase:</strong> Surface assessment, pressure washing, scraping all loose paint, caulking gaps and joints, spot priming bare surfaces. This is the most important day on the job. Prep determines how long the paint lasts.

<strong>Days 2–3 &mdash; First Coat:</strong> Top-to-bottom application. Trim is cut in before rolling or spraying field areas. South and west exposures are scheduled for morning application to avoid midday heat blistering.

<strong>Days 3–4 &mdash; Second Coat:</strong> Full second coat on all surfaces. Three coats on high-UV exposures. Detail work on trim, fascia, and soffits.

<strong>Final Day &mdash; Cleanup &amp; Walkthrough:</strong> Site cleanup, touch-ups, and a final walkthrough with you before any invoice is issued. You do not need to be home during the project &mdash; we coordinate access at the quote stage and send photos throughout.

We provide regular updates throughout your project and are available by phone or text at any stage. You will never wonder where things stand.`,

    faqs: [
      { q: 'How long does exterior paint last in Colorado?', a: 'Budget paint jobs typically last 3-4 years in Northern Colorado due to freeze-thaw cycles and high UV exposure. Premium systems with proper surface prep and high-grade acrylic or elastomeric coatings last 7-10 years. We use Sherwin-Williams Duration and Benjamin Moore Aura &mdash; both formulated for extreme temperature cycling and UV resistance.' },
      { q: 'What prep work is required for exterior painting in Northern Colorado?', a: 'All loose and failing paint must be scraped to stable substrate. Wood siding requires sanding, rot repair, and bare wood priming with oil or shellac-based primers. All gaps, joints, and seams need premium elastomeric caulking. Surfaces are pressure washed to remove dirt, mildew, and chalk. Skipping any of these steps leads to premature failure.' },
      { q: 'Do you handle HOA color approval for exterior painting?', a: 'Yes. Many Northern Colorado communities require HOA approval before exterior color changes. We help navigate the approval process, provide color samples that meet HOA guidelines, and submit all required documentation on your behalf. Most approvals take 2-4 weeks, which we build into project timelines.' },
      { q: 'What does exterior painting cost in Northern Colorado?', a: 'Most premium exterior painting projects for $650K+ homes range from $8,000-$18,000+ depending on home size, siding type, and surface condition. Call or text (970) 670-3965 for an accurate quote based on your specific home.' },
      { q: 'What is the best time of year to paint a home exterior in Northern Colorado?', a: 'Spring (April–May) and fall (September–October) are ideal &mdash; temperatures between 50–85°F, lower wind, and manageable UV. Summer works but west and south-facing surfaces can blister if paint is applied in direct midday sun above 90°F. We schedule around weather and communicate any delays proactively.' },
      { q: 'Do I need to be home while you are painting?', a: 'No. Most homeowners give us gate access, secure their pets, and head to work. We coordinate access at the quote stage, send progress photos throughout the project, and request a final walkthrough before we leave.' },
      { q: 'Can you paint over existing paint without stripping everything?', a: 'Yes, when the existing paint is stable and properly adhered. We scrape all loose and failing areas, feather the edges, and prime bare spots. Full stripping is only required when there is widespread adhesion failure, lead paint remediation, or significant substrate damage. We tell you which situation you are in during the initial assessment.' },
      { q: 'Do you repair wood rot before painting?', a: 'Yes. Minor rot and damaged trim are repaired during prep &mdash; this is part of our standard process, not an add-on. Extensive structural damage may be referred to a carpenter, but we handle everything that is paint-adjacent.' },
      { q: 'What warranty do you offer on exterior painting?', a: 'We stand behind our work. If paint fails due to workmanship issues &mdash; peeling, adhesion failure, excessive fading &mdash; within the first year, we return and fix it. Sherwin-Williams Duration carries a Lifetime Limited warranty when applied by a certified contractor, which we are.' },
      { q: 'Will the color look the same on my house as on the color chip?', a: 'Not always. Color appearance changes with light conditions, surface area, and surrounding landscaping. We recommend buying a test quart and painting a 2-foot swatch in both direct sun and shade on your home before finalizing. We hold off on the full coating order until you have seen it on the house.' },

    intro: `HOA painting projects require a level of coordination most painting contractors are not set up for. Color approval documentation, multi-unit scheduling that minimizes resident disruption, and precise color matching across dozens of homes &mdash; these are requirements, not extras.

Timnath Painting has worked with HOAs across Timnath, Windsor, and Severance. We understand the approval process, carry $1M general liability insurance with COI on request, and deliver consistent color results across every building we touch.`,
    process: `HOA projects begin with a meeting with the property manager or board to confirm scope, color palette, scheduling requirements, and documentation needs.

<strong>Color Coordination:</strong> We work directly with HOA architectural review committees to confirm approved colors, obtain approval letters, and document color specifications for every structure.

<strong>Scheduling:</strong> Multi-unit projects are sequenced to minimize resident disruption. We communicate project timelines directly with affected residents when requested.

<strong>Execution:</strong> Same prep and coating standards as every Timnath Painting project. No shortcuts because the client is an HOA instead of an individual homeowner.`,

    tagline: 'Penetrating Protection. Not Just Color.',
    heroTitle: 'Fence Staining in Northern Colorado &mdash; Built to Survive Colorado\'s Weather',
    intro: `Colorado\'s UV index, freeze-thaw cycles, and wind-driven moisture destroy untreated or poorly stained fences faster than almost anywhere in the country. Solid stains peel. Clear sealers wear off in one season. Penetrating semi-transparent stains &mdash; applied to properly prepared wood &mdash; last 3–5 years and protect the wood from the inside out.

Timnath Painting uses penetrating oil-based and water-based stains from premium manufacturers, applied after proper cleaning, sanding, and wood brightening. We do not brush stain over dirty, weathered wood and call it done.`,
    process: `Every fence project begins with a condition assessment &mdash; existing coating type, wood species, weathering, and moisture content all affect product selection and prep requirements.

<strong>Preparation:</strong> Power washing removes dirt, mildew, and failing stain. Wood brightener restores the wood\'s natural pH and opens the grain to accept stain. Sanding addresses rough surfaces and gray weathered wood.

<strong>Stain Application:</strong> We use penetrating semi-transparent or semi-solid stains that absorb into the wood rather than forming a film on top. Film-forming stains peel. Penetrating stains do not.

<strong>Product Selection:</strong> Stain type, sheen level, and UV protection are selected based on wood species, sun exposure, and existing finish.`,
    woodTypes: [
      { type: 'Cedar', desc: 'The most common fence material in Northern Colorado HOA communities. Cedar is naturally rot-resistant but dries out fast at altitude. Semi-transparent penetrating stains let the grain show while keeping moisture out. We recommend restaining every 3–4 years on cedar in full-sun exposures.' },
      { type: 'Pine and Spruce', desc: 'Less dense than cedar and more prone to checking and splitting without regular stain maintenance. Pine fences benefit from semi-solid stains that provide heavier UV protection while still penetrating the wood fiber. South and west-facing pine sections need the most attention.' },
      { type: 'Pressure-Treated Lumber', desc: 'Pressure-treated wood must fully dry before staining &mdash; typically 6–12 months after installation for new construction. We test moisture content before any product goes on. Staining too early causes adhesion failure and premature peeling.' },
      { type: 'Weathered and Gray Wood', desc: 'Gray, silvery fence wood is not just a cosmetic problem. UV exposure has broken down the surface fibers and closed the grain. We apply a wood brightener and light sanding before staining to open the grain and restore the wood\'s ability to accept penetrating product.' },
    ],
    whyUs: `Most homeowners try to stain their own fence at least once. They buy a semi-transparent from the hardware store, roll it on, and two years later it looks worse than before &mdash; because the wood was not clean, the grain was not open, or the product was a film-former instead of a penetrating stain.

We eliminate that outcome. We prep the wood correctly, select the right product for the wood species and condition, and apply it in the right weather window. Staining in direct midday sun or when rain is forecast within 48 hours ruins the result. We schedule around both.

Our work comes with a workmanship guarantee. If the stain fails early due to our application, we come back and address it.`,
    timeline: `Fence staining projects in Northern Colorado typically take 1–2 days, depending on fence length and prep condition.

<strong>Prep Phase:</strong> Power washing to remove dirt, mildew, and failing stain. Application of wood brightener on weathered or gray wood. Allow to dry completely &mdash; typically 24–48 hours before stain application.

<strong>Stain Application:</strong> First coat of penetrating stain applied by brush, roller, or airless sprayer depending on fence profile. Second coat applied wet-on-wet on new or bare wood, or after dry time on previously stained surfaces.

<strong>Cure &amp; Ready to Use:</strong> Most penetrating stains are dry to touch within 2–4 hours and fully cured within 24–48 hours. We advise keeping pets and sprinklers off the fence during cure time.

UV exposure at altitude accelerates degradation, so south and west-facing sections may need restaining sooner.' },
      { q: 'Should I use oil-based or water-based stain on my fence?', a: 'Both work well when properly selected for the wood species and condition. Oil-based stains penetrate deeper on dense woods and aged surfaces. Water-based stains dry faster, have lower VOC content, and are easier to clean up. We recommend specific products after assessing your fence\' wood type, current condition, and sun exposure.' },
      { q: 'Does the fence need to be cleaned before staining?', a: 'Yes. Power washing removes dirt, mildew, and old failing stain. For weathered gray wood, we apply a wood brightener to restore the wood\'s natural color and pH before staining. Skipping cleaning means the stain bonds to surface contamination instead of wood fibers and fails early.' },
      { q: 'What does fence staining cost in Northern Colorado?', a: 'Fence staining typically costs $2–$5 per linear foot depending on fence height, condition, number of sides, and stain type. A 150-foot privacy fence in average condition runs $600–$1,200. Call or text (970) 670-3965 for an accurate estimate.' },
      { q: 'Can I stain a new fence right away?', a: 'Not if it is pressure-treated. PT lumber needs 6–12 months to fully dry before staining. Staining too early traps moisture and causes the stain to fail within a season. For new cedar or pine fences, we test moisture content first and only proceed when the wood is ready.' },
      { q: 'How do I know when my fence needs to be restained?', a: 'The water test: splash water on the fence. If it beads up, the stain is still protecting the wood. If it soaks in within seconds, the stain has worn off and the wood is exposed. Gray, silvery color is another sign &mdash; it means UV has broken down the surface fibers and the wood needs treatment.' },
      { q: 'Do you stain HOA community fences?', a: 'Yes. HOA community fence staining is one of our most common commercial and multi-family projects. We coordinate scheduling and color approval with property managers and provide COI on request.' },

    tagline: 'Penetrating Stains for Lasting Protection',
    heroTitle: 'Exterior Staining in Northern Colorado &mdash; Wood That Lasts',
    intro: `Log homes, cedar siding, wood decks, and natural wood trim all require staining &mdash; not painting &mdash; to maintain their appearance and structural integrity in Colorado\'s climate. Paint traps moisture in wood and eventually peels. Penetrating stains work with the wood, allowing it to breathe while protecting against UV degradation, moisture intrusion, and freeze-thaw damage.

Timnath Painting specializes in exterior staining for natural wood surfaces across Northern Colorado. We use premium penetrating oil and water-based stains and prepare surfaces properly before any product touches the wood.`,
    process: `Exterior staining projects begin with a full surface assessment &mdash; existing finish type, wood species and condition, moisture content, and exposure level all drive product selection.

<strong>Preparation:</strong> All surfaces are cleaned thoroughly &mdash; power washing, mildew treatment, and wood brightening where needed. Failed existing stain is stripped or sanded. Bare wood is allowed to dry completely before application.

<strong>Stain Application:</strong> We use penetrating stains from Defy, Armstrong Clark, TWP, and Ready Seal &mdash; products specifically formulated for Colorado\'s UV intensity and freeze-thaw cycles. Application method is selected based on surface profile.

<strong>Two-Coat Application:</strong> Most exterior staining projects require two coats &mdash; a wet-on-wet application on new wood or a second coat after proper dry time on previously stained surfaces.`,
    surfaceTypes: [
      { type: 'Log Homes', desc: 'Log homes require the most preparation of any exterior staining project. Existing failed stain must be stripped by hand, sanding, or chemical stripping depending on the coating type. We use oil-based penetrating stains specifically formulated for large-diameter log profiles, applied with brush work to ensure full penetration into the wood.' },
      { type: 'Cedar and Wood Siding', desc: 'Cedar siding is the most common exterior staining surface in Northern Colorado. We select stain opacity &mdash; clear, semi-transparent, or semi-solid &mdash; based on the existing condition of the wood and the homeowner\'s preference for grain visibility. Colorado\'s UV intensity means semi-transparent or semi-solid stains are typically the right choice for long-term protection.' },
      { type: 'Wood Decks', desc: 'Deck surfaces take far more abuse than vertical siding &mdash; foot traffic, UV, standing water, and freeze-thaw cycling all attack horizontal surfaces. We use deck-specific penetrating stains rated for horizontal applications and always include the deck railing and fascia boards in the scope.' },
      { type: 'Pergolas and Arbors', desc: 'Overhead structures are often forgotten until the wood splits and grays beyond recovery. We stain pergolas and arbors on the same prep-and-penetrate system we use for siding, with particular attention to end-grain surfaces where water intrusion starts.' },
      { type: 'Shake Siding', desc: 'Cedar shake and shingle siding requires brush application to get stain into the overlapping joints where moisture collects. We apply by brush on all shake siding &mdash; never sprayed only &mdash; to ensure full coverage behind each course.' },
    ],
    whyUs: `Exterior staining is a specialty, not a side service. The difference between a stain job that lasts 5 years and one that fails in 18 months comes down to three things: surface prep, product selection, and application timing.

We test wood moisture before any product goes on. We select stain formulations based on wood species, existing coating condition, and UV exposure &mdash; not just whatever is on the shelf. And we do not stain in direct midday sun or within 48 hours of rain. Application timing in Colorado\'s climate matters more than most contractors acknowledge.

We use premium eco-friendly, no-VOC products by Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore that meet Colorado\'s VOC compliance standards. For homeowners in HOA communities, we coordinate color approval before any stain product is opened.`,
    timeline: `Exterior staining timelines depend on surface area and wood condition, but here is how a standard Northern Colorado project runs.

<strong>Assessment &amp; Prep Phase:</strong> We assess the existing finish, test moisture content, and begin cleaning. Power washing and mildew treatment are completed on day one. Wood brightener is applied where needed and allowed to work overnight.

<strong>Dry &amp; Inspect:</strong> Wood must be fully dry before staining &mdash; we confirm moisture levels are in the acceptable range before proceeding. On log homes with deep checking, we caulk any open splits with stainable caulk.

<strong>Stain Application:</strong> First coat applied by brush, roller, or sprayer depending on surface profile. Log homes and shake siding are always brush-applied for penetration. Flat siding can be sprayed and back-brushed.

<strong>Final Coat &amp; Cure:</strong> Second coat applied after appropriate dry time. Most penetrating stains cure within 24–48 hours for light use and 72 hours for full weather exposure.

We provide regular updates throughout your project and are available by phone or text at any stage. You will never wonder where things stand.`,

    faqs: [
      { q: 'What types of exterior surfaces can be stained?', a: 'We stain wood siding (cedar, pine, redwood, T1-11), log homes, wood decks, pergolas, fences, wood trim, and shake siding. Each surface type requires specific stain formulation and prep approach. Composite or PVC surfaces are not candidates for staining.' },
      { q: 'How do I know if my wood needs staining or painting?', a: 'Natural wood with visible grain that has previously been stained should be restained. Wood that has been painted should be repainted. Converting from paint to stain requires full paint removal &mdash; a major project. If you are unsure, we assess the existing finish during our on-site evaluation.' },
      { q: 'How often does exterior wood need to be restained in Colorado?', a: 'Northern Colorado\'s UV intensity and freeze-thaw cycles accelerate coating breakdown. Most exterior staining lasts 3–5 years with premium products and proper prep. South and west-facing surfaces may need attention sooner. Annual inspection catches early signs of failure before water intrusion causes wood damage.' },
      { q: 'What does exterior staining cost in Northern Colorado?', a: 'Exterior staining costs vary significantly based on surface area, wood species, condition, and accessibility. Deck staining typically runs $1.50–$3.50 per square foot. Log home exteriors vary by complexity. Call or text (970) 670-3965 for an on-site assessment and accurate quote.' },
      { q: 'Can you stain a log home?', a: 'Yes. Log home staining is one of our more involved projects because it requires full strip prep on failed existing coatings, checking of all log checks and joints, and brush application to ensure stain penetrates around the full log profile. We use oil-based penetrating products specifically formulated for log construction.' },
      { q: 'What is the best stain product for Colorado conditions?', a: 'We use Armstrong Clark, TWP (Total Wood Preservative), Defy Extreme, and Ready Seal depending on the application. All are penetrating formulations rated for Colorado\'s UV intensity and freeze-thaw cycling. We do not use hardware-store deck stains on log homes or shake siding.' },
      { q: 'Do you prep and stain decks?', a: 'Yes. Deck staining includes cleaning, brightening, and sanding the deck surface, then applying a penetrating deck stain rated for horizontal use. We include railings, balusters, and fascia boards in every deck stain project &mdash; not just the deck boards.' },
      { q: 'How long do I need to stay off the deck after staining?', a: 'Most penetrating deck stains are dry to light foot traffic in 4–8 hours and ready for normal use in 24–48 hours. We advise keeping pets and furniture off for 24 hours and avoiding sprinklers or heavy rain for 48 hours after application.' },
