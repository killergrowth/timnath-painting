    heroTitle: 'HOA Painting in Northern Colorado \u2014 Color Approval to Final Coat',
    intro: \`HOA painting projects require a level of coordination most painting contractors are not set up for. Color approval documentation, multi-unit scheduling that minimizes resident disruption, and precise color matching across dozens of homes \u2014 these are requirements, not extras.

Timnath Painting has worked with HOAs across Timnath, Windsor, and Severance. We understand the approval process, carry $1M general liability insurance with COI on request, and deliver consistent color results across every building we touch.\`,
    process: \`HOA projects begin with a meeting with the property manager or board to confirm scope, color palette, scheduling requirements, and documentation needs.

<strong>Color Coordination:</strong> We work directly with HOA architectural review committees to confirm approved colors, obtain approval letters, and document color specifications for every structure.

<strong>Scheduling:</strong> Multi-unit projects are sequenced to minimize resident disruption. We communicate project timelines directly with affected residents when requested.

<strong>Execution:</strong> Same prep and coating standards as every Timnath Painting project. No shortcuts because the client is an HOA instead of an individual homeowner.\`,
    propertyTypes: [
      { type: 'Single-Family HOA Homes', desc: 'The most common HOA project in Timnath and Windsor. We handle color sample submission, approval documentation, and precise color matching across every home in the community \u2014 so the neighborhood looks intentional, not patchwork.' },
      { type: 'Townhomes and Attached Units', desc: 'Shared wall structures require careful masking and crew coordination to avoid paint transfer between units. We sequence townhome projects unit-by-unit to minimize resident disruption while maintaining color consistency across the row.' },
      { type: 'Multi-Unit Apartment Buildings', desc: 'Large-scale repaints require industrial staging, after-hours flexibility, and reliable crew scheduling. We bring the same owned crew to every day of a multi-unit project \u2014 no rotating subs, no quality inconsistency between buildings.' },

    ],
    whyUs: \`HOA boards have one core concern: consistency. Every home in the community needs to look the same, and any variation \u2014 even a slight color shift from unit to unit \u2014 gets flagged by residents and can create compliance problems with the governing documents.

We eliminate that risk. We use spectrophotometer color matching and coordinate directly with Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore reps to lock in exact color codes for every project. When we come back the following year for additional units, the color is right.

Our $1M general liability policy covers multi-unit projects. Certificates of insurance are available within 24 hours to any property manager or board that requests one. We have never had a board wait on a COI from us.\`,
    timeline: \`HOA project timelines depend on unit count, but here is how a standard Timnath or Windsor neighborhood project runs.

<strong>Week 1 \u2014 Color Approval:</strong> We submit color samples and documentation to the architectural review committee. Most Northern Colorado HOAs turn approvals in 2\u20134 weeks. We build this into the project timeline and never start coating without written approval in hand.

<strong>Week 2\u20133 \u2014 Prep:</strong> Pressure washing, scraping, caulking, and priming across all approved units. We work sequentially through the community to keep the timeline predictable for residents.

<strong>Weeks 3\u20135 \u2014 Coating:</strong> Two-coat minimum on all surfaces. We document color codes used for each unit for future reference.

<strong>Final \u2014 Walkthrough:</strong> Board representative or property manager walkthrough before any final invoice is issued. We address any punch list items same-day.\`,

    tagline: 'After-Hours Scheduling. Zero Disruption.',
    heroTitle: 'Commercial Painting in Northern Colorado \u2014 Built Around Your Schedule',
    intro: \`Timnath Painting provides commercial painting in Northern Colorado for strip malls, office buildings, and multi-family properties along the I-25 corridor. We specialize in after-hours scheduling, use commercial-grade coatings built for Colorado\\'s 28+ annual freeze-thaw cycles, and carry $1M general liability insurance with certificates available on request.

Your commercial property takes the same beating from Colorado\\'s climate as any home. But unlike residential work, your repaint cannot shut down your business for two weeks.\`,
    process: \`We start with a site assessment and schedule consultation. Most commercial clients need after-hours or weekend work to avoid disrupting operations. We accommodate that.

<strong>Surface Prep:</strong> Pressure wash, scrape failing coatings, repair substrate damage, prime bare wood or metal, caulk every penetration. Colorado\\'s climate demands this foundation \u2014 shortcuts fail within two years.

<strong>Coating Selection:</strong> We use elastomeric and commercial-grade coatings from Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore. Elastomeric coatings bridge hairline cracks and flex with temperature swings. Industrial acrylics resist UV degradation through Colorado\\'s 300+ sunny days per year.

<strong>Documentation:</strong> Certificates of insurance available within 24 hours. We coordinate with property managers on access, security, and scheduling requirements.\`,
    buildingTypes: [
      { type: 'Retail and Strip Mall Exteriors', desc: 'Storefronts and retail centers along the I-25 corridor need coatings that hold up to high UV and freeze-thaw cycles without peeling or fading within two years.

    ],
    whyUs: \`Commercial painting bids are easy to get. Reliable execution is harder to find. Most commercial painting contractors in Northern Colorado use subcontractors, which means the crew on day one may not be the crew on day five. Quality variation and scheduling gaps are the result.

Timnath Painting brings an owned crew to every commercial project. The same people who assess the job are the ones who do the work. We do not pass commercial projects off to subs when we get busy.

We carry $1M general liability insurance and workers\\' compensation on all crew members. COI is available within 24 hours. For property management companies that need to be listed as additional insured, we accommodate that at no cost.\`,
    timeline: \`Commercial project timelines depend on building size and schedule constraints, but here is how a standard Northern Colorado commercial repaint runs.

<strong>Week 1 \u2014 Assessment and Scheduling:</strong> On-site assessment, scope confirmation, COI delivery, and schedule build. We identify any after-hours or weekend requirements and lock in access protocols with building management.

<strong>Weeks 1\u20132 \u2014 Prep:</strong> Pressure washing, scraping, substrate repairs, priming. We work around your operating hours. Most prep can be completed during evening shifts.

<strong>Weeks 2\u20133 \u2014 Coating:</strong> First and second coat application. Elastomeric systems require specific dry times between coats that we factor into the schedule. We do not rush dry times.

<strong>Final \u2014 Punch List:</strong> Property manager walkthrough, punch list documentation, and touch-up completion before invoice.\`,

    tagline: 'Penetrating Protection. Not Just Color.',
    heroTitle: 'Fence Staining in Northern Colorado \u2014 Built to Survive Colorado\\'s Weather',
    intro: \`Colorado\\'s UV index, freeze-thaw cycles, and wind-driven moisture destroy untreated or poorly stained fences faster than almost anywhere in the country. Solid stains peel. Clear sealers wear off in one season. Penetrating semi-transparent stains \u2014 applied to properly prepared wood \u2014 last 3\u20135 years and protect the wood from the inside out.

Timnath Painting uses penetrating oil-based and water-based stains from premium manufacturers, applied after proper cleaning, sanding, and wood brightening. We do not brush stain over dirty, weathered wood and call it done.\`,
    process: \`Every fence project begins with a condition assessment \u2014 existing coating type, wood species, weathering, and moisture content all affect product selection and prep requirements.

<strong>Preparation:</strong> Power washing removes dirt, mildew, and failing stain. Wood brightener restores the wood\\'s natural pH and opens the grain to accept stain. Sanding addresses rough surfaces and gray weathered wood.

<strong>Stain Application:</strong> We use penetrating semi-transparent or semi-solid stains that absorb into the wood rather than forming a film on top. Film-forming stains peel. Penetrating stains do not.

<strong>Product Selection:</strong> Stain type, sheen level, and UV protection are selected based on wood species, sun exposure, and existing finish.\`,
    woodTypes: [
      { type: 'Cedar', desc: 'The most common fence material in Northern Colorado HOA communities. Cedar is naturally rot-resistant but dries out fast at altitude. Semi-transparent penetrating stains let the grain show while keeping moisture out. We recommend restaining every 3\u20134 years on cedar in full-sun exposures.' },
      { type: 'Pine and Spruce', desc: 'Less dense than cedar and more prone to checking and splitting without regular stain maintenance. Pine fences benefit from semi-solid stains that provide heavier UV protection while still penetrating the wood fiber. South and west-facing pine sections need the most attention.' },
      { type: 'Pressure-Treated Lumber', desc: 'Pressure-treated wood must fully dry before staining \u2014 typically 6\u201312 months after installation for new construction. We test moisture content before any product goes on. Staining too early causes adhesion failure and premature peeling.' },
      { type: 'Weathered and Gray Wood', desc: 'Gray, silvery fence wood is not just a cosmetic problem. UV exposure has broken down the surface fibers and closed the grain. We apply a wood brightener and light sanding before staining to open the grain and restore the wood\\'s ability to accept penetrating product.' },
    ],
    whyUs: \`Most homeowners try to stain their own fence at least once. They buy a semi-transparent from the hardware store, roll it on, and two years later it looks worse than before \u2014 because the wood was not clean, the grain was not open, or the product was a film-former instead of a penetrating stain.

We eliminate that outcome. We prep the wood correctly, select the right product for the wood species and condition, and apply it in the right weather window. Staining in direct midday sun or when rain is forecast within 48 hours ruins the result. We schedule around both.

Our work comes with a workmanship guarantee. If the stain fails early due to our application, we come back and address it.\`,
    timeline: \`Fence staining projects in Northern Colorado typically take 1\u20132 days, depending on fence length and prep condition.

<strong>Day 1 \u2014 Prep:</strong> Power washing to remove dirt, mildew, and failing stain. Application of wood brightener on weathered or gray wood. Allow to dry completely \u2014 typically 24\u201348 hours before stain application.

<strong>Day 2 \u2014 Stain Application:</strong> First coat of penetrating stain applied by brush, roller, or airless sprayer depending on fence profile. Second coat applied wet-on-wet on new or bare wood, or after dry time on previously stained surfaces.

<strong>Dry and Cure:</strong> Most penetrating stains are dry to touch within 2\u20134 hours and fully cured within 24\u201348 hours. We advise keeping pets and sprinklers off the fence during cure time.\`,

      { q: 'Should I use oil-based or water-based stain on my fence?', a: 'Both work well when properly selected for the wood species and condition.

We recommend specific products after assessing your fence\\' wood type, current condition, and sun exposure.' },
      { q: 'Does the fence need to be cleaned before staining?', a: 'Yes. Power washing removes dirt, mildew, and old failing stain.

    tagline: 'Penetrating Stains for Lasting Protection',
    heroTitle: 'Exterior Staining in Northern Colorado \u2014 Wood That Lasts',
    intro: \`Log homes, cedar siding, wood decks, and natural wood trim all require staining \u2014 not painting \u2014 to maintain their appearance and structural integrity in Colorado\\'s climate. Paint traps moisture in wood and eventually peels. Penetrating stains work with the wood, allowing it to breathe while protecting against UV degradation, moisture intrusion, and freeze-thaw damage.

Timnath Painting specializes in exterior staining for natural wood surfaces across Northern Colorado. We use premium penetrating oil and water-based stains and prepare surfaces properly before any product touches the wood.\`,
    process: \`Exterior staining projects begin with a full surface assessment \u2014 existing finish type, wood species and condition, moisture content, and exposure level all drive product selection.

<strong>Preparation:</strong> All surfaces are cleaned thoroughly \u2014 power washing, mildew treatment, and wood brightening where needed. Failed existing stain is stripped or sanded. Bare wood is allowed to dry completely before application.

<strong>Stain Application:</strong> We use penetrating stains from Defy, Armstrong Clark, TWP, and Ready Seal \u2014 products specifically formulated for Colorado\\'s UV intensity and freeze-thaw cycles. Application method is selected based on surface profile.

<strong>Two-Coat Application:</strong> Most exterior staining projects require two coats \u2014 a wet-on-wet application on new wood or a second coat after proper dry time on previously stained surfaces.\`,
    surfaceTypes: [
      { type: 'Log Homes', desc: 'Log homes require the most preparation of any exterior staining project. Existing failed stain must be stripped by hand, sanding, or chemical stripping depending on the coating type. We use oil-based penetrating stains specifically formulated for large-diameter log profiles, applied with brush work to ensure full penetration into the wood.' },
      { type: 'Cedar and Wood Siding', desc: 'Cedar siding is the most common exterior staining surface in Northern Colorado. We select stain opacity \u2014 clear, semi-transparent, or semi-solid \u2014 based on the existing condition of the wood and the homeowner\\'s preference for grain visibility. Colorado\\'s UV intensity means semi-transparent or semi-solid stains are typically the right choice for long-term protection.' },
      { type: 'Wood Decks', desc: 'Deck surfaces take far more abuse than vertical siding \u2014 foot traffic, UV, standing water, and freeze-thaw cycling all attack horizontal surfaces. We use deck-specific penetrating stains rated for horizontal applications and always include the deck railing and fascia boards in the scope.' },
      { type: 'Pergolas and Arbors', desc: 'Overhead structures are often forgotten until the wood splits and grays beyond recovery. We stain pergolas and arbors on the same prep-and-penetrate system we use for siding, with particular attention to end-grain surfaces where water intrusion starts.' },
      { type: 'Shake Siding', desc: 'Cedar shake and shingle siding requires brush application to get stain into the overlapping joints where moisture collects. We apply by brush on all shake siding \u2014 never sprayed only \u2014 to ensure full coverage behind each course.' },
    ],
    whyUs: \`Exterior staining is a specialty, not a side service. The difference between a stain job that lasts 5 years and one that fails in 18 months comes down to three things: surface prep, product selection, and application timing.

We test wood moisture before any product goes on. We select stain formulations based on wood species, existing coating condition, and UV exposure \u2014 not just whatever is on the shelf. And we do not stain in direct midday sun or within 48 hours of rain. Application timing in Colorado\\'s climate matters more than most contractors acknowledge.

We use premium eco-friendly, no-VOC products by Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore that meet Colorado\\'s VOC compliance standards. For homeowners in HOA communities, we coordinate color approval before any stain product is opened.\`,
    timeline: \`Exterior staining timelines depend on surface area and wood condition, but here is how a standard Northern Colorado project runs.

<strong>Day 1 \u2014 Assessment and Prep:</strong> We assess the existing finish, test moisture content, and begin cleaning. Power washing and mildew treatment are completed on day one. Wood brightener is applied where needed and allowed to work overnight.

<strong>Day 2 \u2014 Dry and Inspect:</strong> Wood must be fully dry before staining \u2014 we confirm moisture levels are in the acceptable range before proceeding. On log homes with deep checking, we caulk any open splits with stainable caulk.

<strong>Day 2\u20133 \u2014 Stain Application:</strong> First coat applied by brush, roller, or sprayer depending on surface profile. Log homes and shake siding are always brush-applied for penetration. Flat siding can be sprayed and back-brushed.

<strong>Final Coat and Cure:</strong> Second coat applied after appropriate dry time. Most penetrating stains cure within 24\u201348 hours for light use and 72 hours for full weather exposure.\`,

      { q: 'What types of exterior surfaces can be stained?', a: 'We stain wood siding (cedar, pine, redwood, T1-11), log homes, wood decks, pergolas, fences, wood trim, and shake siding. Each surface type requires specific stain formulation and prep approach. Composite or PVC surfaces are not candidates for staining.' },
      { q: 'How do I know if my wood needs staining or painting?', a: 'Natural wood with visible grain that has previously been stained should be restained.
